# Guided Conversation: Collaboration Skills for Software Engineers

60 minutes, 10-13 questions, 4-8 minutes per question.

1.	What's your name, how long have you been a developer, and roughly how many lines of code were in the biggest project you've worked on?
2.	You may be familiar with the concept known as the "[Norris Number](https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/norris-numbers.html)", this idea that it takes different kinds of skills to work on different size project. The bottom rung is around 2000 lines of code - what do you consider the core skills to work on projects that size?
3.	Norris Numbers typically increase in powers of ten, so let's talk about projects around 20,000 lines of code - what additional or different skills do you think are needed here?
4.	Getting bigger - now we're transitioning to 200,000 lines of code - what new skills or techniques do we need?
5.	Last one for Norris Numbers we'll talk about - 2 million lines of code - what do we need now?
6.	Switching gears, but staying with the same concept, can we talk about a Norris-like number for working together in a team? Let's try to establish a baseline and some kind of scaling factor. What's the basic "team" size that anybody can work in without any specific training? (2 pizzas?, 7+/-2? etc.)
7.	Starting at the baseline then, what do we consider the "baseline" collaboration skills needed by software engineers?
8.	And going up one level - how do we scale? Fibonacci, square, cube? - And what additional or different skills do you think are needed now?
* (ad nauseam as time allows?)
* Are these "team skills" (e.g. team must have at least 1 person with this skill) or individual skills (e.g. everybody on team must have this skill)?
9.	Do we see any patterns or similarities between kLOC curve and the team-size curve? Does "more kLOC" have to mean "bigger team"? 
10.	How would you differentiate between "engineering skills" and "collaboration skills"?
11.	How do the collaboration skills we've talked about translate outside of software engineering? What are some industries we might learn collaboration skills from? What should we ask?
12.	What else could we discuss in this context, if we scheduled another/follow-up conversation?
